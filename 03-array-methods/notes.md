# ✅ map() in JavaScript
👉 What is map()?

map() is used to transform each element of an array and return a new array.

## It does NOT modify original array

## Always returns a same-length array




# ✅ reduce() — Aggregation (Most Powerful)

👉 Reduces array to single value
👉 Used for totals, counts, grouping

🧠 Think:

“Combine everything into ONE result”
